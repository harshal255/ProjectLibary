        "Abstract": "There is ample amount of data on the internet available. But the data is in such a way that one cannot find the desired information from the ocean of data in specific format. Extracting precise, concise and useful information from larger sets of unstructured text data can be a tedious and time consuming task. For that, we try to convert this unstructured, raw text data into a specific format which can be used in such a way that important information with the use of knowledge graph is obtained. The user can fire queries as per their necessity and\nbased on the generated knowledge graph the required information from these large chunks of data can be retrieved. Knowledge Graph is an efficient way to visualise a trail of facts based on specific entities. It acquires and integrates information into ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge.\nHence, with the use of knowledge graph and text processing we aim to achieve efficient query based information retrieval system.",

Tracking people from video footage at public places like malls,\noffices, educational institutions, restaurants has many applications and useful for various\nbusiness analytical tasks. Internet enabled security cameras and advancements in the field of\nIOT in the last decade caused significant rise in video surveillance applications. Manual\nanalysis of videos from every camera is difficult and challenging work. Recent development\nin computer vision techniques and deep learning has established research scope in the field of\nautomated video surveillance. Person reidentification aims to recognise and associate a target\npedestrian at different occasions after having previously appeared in several cameras with\nnon overlapping views. It enables automated tracking of pedestrian through different\ndisjointed camera views and focuses on learning and extracting feature representation of a\nperson.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, Data is an integral and many precious parts of the internet. Data can help us\nto improve our life style with better results. Our aim is to create centralize portal for patients\ndata generated by Hospitals. Doctors use this platform to understand patient’s history and\ndiagnose them accordingly. Doctor’s can use technologies like data mining and AI features to\ndo their work faster. Government also use this for proper health care system for people.\nWhat if all the past records of a patient gets stored on a single platform? What if his/her\npast reports appears on a finger click? What if we could also get some \"AkashVani\" about the\ndiseases in our area? What if we have so called \"Trends\" based on seasons and locality based\ndiseases? How good and helpful it would become for the doctors to examine the patient and\ngive the accurate or best prescription as per his/her body's requirements. It would be like a boon\nfor all of us(the society). We could prepare ourselves by taking the necessary precautions\nagainst the diseases that were declared in the \"Trends\" or \"AkashVani\".Our website will make\nthis happen. We are going to provide a central repository, which will contain all the past records\nand reports of the users, spanning from each and every hospital and doctor he/she had visited.\nThis will help the doctors to identify the exact nurve of the patient, following which the\ntreatment becomes easier and accurate. We are also going to provide an AI based trend and\nsurvey model. With the help of vast amount of data that we will receive and by mining which\nwe would be able to represent the 'seasonal diseases, their causes, remedies, and precaution\nsteps'.So, we are determined to make this planet a happy and healthy planet.",

        "Abstract": "Today, Vehicles are increasing day by day. The problem of traffic has been\na big issue. Especially in metropolitan cities like Ahmedabad, Mumbai,\nDelhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore it has been a very serious problem.\nThe management of this traffic is also very important. Currently it is being\ndone with the help of Traffic signal and Traffic Police. But, the problem with\nthe current scenario is that for every side there will be fixed timer and a\nconstant amount of time will be given to people on every side. Many times it\nwill lead to wastage of time and increase in traffic. Because it is possible that\none side of the vehicle have enormous amount of vehicles and while the other\nfew side might have very less amount of vehicles and we will allocate same\namount of time to all of them which will lead to wastage if time as well as\nwastage of Energy. So our project is, with the use of ‘Image Processing’ and\n‘Deep Learning’ we will make a system such that every side will have timer\naccording to the traffic density it has. Here first we will set up the camera at\nthe traffic signal upto certain distance and which will be used for shooting\nvideos and using these videos with the help of deep learning algorithms we\nwill identify the number of objects. Thus by knowing the density of the traffic\nwe can set our timers according to density. Which will lead to ‘Saving of\nEnergy’ as well as ‘Saving of Time’.",

At the small age, children have lots of questions. The device can understand\nquestions and give answers based on machine learning. This device can be fitted in toy , So this\nis like their new friend. The microphone is fitted in toy so whatever is said is actually transmitted\nto server, where it is analyzed and the servers will transmit the most appropriate response back.",

Well it is important to know if you are charged accordingly so the need\nis quite certain. Well we automate the system by allowing users to monitor\nenergy meter readings over the internet. Our proposed system uses energy meter\nwith arduino system to monitor energy usage using a meter .The meter is used to\nmonitor units consumed and transmit the units as well as cost charged over the\ninternet using Wi-Fi connection. This allows user to easily check the energy\nusage along with the cost charged online using a simple web application. Thus\nthe energy meter monitoring system allows user to effectively monitor electricity\nmeter readings and check the billing online with ease. It presents a low cost and\nflexible energy meter monitoring system using IOT.This technology offers new\nand exciting opportunity to reduce our work and to prevent the equipments from\ndamages.",

It is useful for car owners when their\ncar gets damaged and for insurance companies when they have to process insurance claims and\nGarages for cost estimation and time estimation for repairing of external parts. Many times\ninsurance companies have to perform onsite checking of damaged cars to decide the amount to\nbe given to the victim of accident. Our project helps them to decide this.\nSome of the main functionalities of our project is detecting car damage, helps in detecting fraud\ni.e. if anyone tried to cheat the insurance company it can be detected, cost estimate for helping\nthe victim. The user will have to take pictures of the damaged car parts and upload them to the\nwebsite. After uploading the pictures, the insurance company operative will check them, verify\nthe validity of owner and provide the cost estimate.\nInsurance company operative will be able to check the pictures uploaded on the website to\ndetermine the claim amount to be provided to the victim of accident and validity of the\ndamaged car can be determined by detecting the number plate on the car. Also when car owner\nuploads the pictures then he/she will be given approximate claim amount that he/she will be\nreceiving based on policy of insurance company.\nGarages will be able to check the external damage done to the car like scratches, dents, broken\nside lights, glasses, missing parts of the car etc. So it is easy to estimate the cost of the repairing\nthe car and provide the estimated time to repair the car. Garages can check the damaged parts\nare available for replacing and if, the parts are not available then they can order them.",
