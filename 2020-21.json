        "Abstract": "The main perspective of \"Intkut'' is to provide a solution that can detect fake videos generated by Deep Learning Technology sensing with the help of convolutional neural networks and Generative adversarial networks. The main objective of any countermeasure to mitigating malicious synthetic media’s negative societal impact must be two-fold. One, to reduce the exposure to malicious deepfakes and second, to minimize the damage it can inflict. This application can be used by social media companies, media news companies and the government to reduce the fake videos and decrease the proportion of fake news. A multi layered convolutional neural network will be used along with Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) to encode and decode the characteristics of objects and process them through the neural network to detect the legibility of the video or image. This application can also be used by the defense ministry of the country to evaluate the genuineness of the content received from potential threats.",

Unemployment rate is the most common and important Economic Indicator. When Data is structured it is easy to understand and maintain. Unemployment is crucial for government to look at as our country grows if the employment rate are fare at every state and every part of the nation. “Dive in Unemployment” is a Data Visualization and Predicting Tool that make the tons of data, understandable and Easy to Analyse as well as predict unemployment with the help Historical Data and considering real time situation. It shows data in a pictorial Representation with Graphs, Pie charts, Maps and many Visual Data. This helps Government to analyses each state with its unemployment rate, Male/Female ratio of Employment, Year wise analyses, Data of Urban and Rural part of country. On the basis of analyses Government can suggest the Scheme for the underdeveloped area. This will ensure that every part of Country is taken care and not neglected. This also helps in analyses of Women Empowerment with help of Male/Female ratio Data Analyses. So with Data Visualization We get better Idea and better Picture of the Unemployment. And most important aspect is predicting unemployment at small level so that Government can manage and work on those factors. As for dealing with this large Data is cumbersome, our system will help Government to better manage our Country as a whole with all features at a place",

Deep learning advances however have also been employed to create software that can cause threats to privacy, democracy and national security. One of those deep learning_x0002_powered applications recently emerged is “deepfake”. Deepfake (stemming from “deep learning” and “fake”) is a technique that can superimpose face images of a target person to a video of a source person to create a video of the target person doing or saying things the source person does. Deepfake algorithms can create fake images and videos that humans cannot distinguish them from authentic ones. The proposal of technologies that can automatically detect and assess the integrity of digital visual media is therefore indispensable. We present extensive discussions on challenges, research trends and directions related to deepfake technologies. By reviewing the background of deepfakes and state-of- the-art deepfake detection methods, this study provides a comprehensive overview of deepfake techniques and facilitates the development of new and more robust methods to deal with the increasingly challenging deepfakes.",

We can simplify and automate this procedure and eliminate human intervention completely by using new technologies.

        "Abstract": "There is no automatic System that detects change between the current and past images for comparison in the satellite imagery platform. so, to solve this problem the model we are developing will use OpenCV Techniques to detect the change in the area, to detect objects in that area, and will visualize those changes by putting marks on that change detection. Our approach for solving the problem is JPG image given by satellite will be re-projected by the python image processing function then data-set will be developed and classification of the image will proceed. Change Detection is Already Running in High-end JPG Images but also giving good Accuracy in Low-End ISRO Images as well. Feature Detection will be only performed on changed areas rather than full images to get to know what is changed in a particular period. So, by that, we will get the image object, changes between the images, and Feature Extractions attribute. These outputs will be visualized on the Django-based web-platform. by Using GPU System, the execution will take lesser time than today's Automatic Systems as well. Automatic alerts of change detection, Pattern recognition of events, visuals, classification based on the land area type will be provided in the project",

And the children found (known or unknown) details are uploaded by the police or by an appointed agent. Entering details of the children like height, age, etc is a lengthy process and the search output is not efficient. So to avoid this ambiguity we use image processing technique here, a person can upload a picture of whose information is to be known. This Image will be mapped or compared with the images in the database and case details status etc can be displayed. The time efficiency is more and output is also efficient",

Also, the facility of customers can select the items from his favourite stores according to their needs. Grocery shopping is a very boring, but an unavoidable business. Want to get rid of it? Then do so. How? This is how. Order groceries online, from top online grocery store and sit back and relax. Yes, it is that simple. Get rid of the tedious task of commuting to the local store for buying groceries. You can get great deals online as well based on festivals. So, here’s an app of the best online grocery store that you help you shop like a pro. The uniqueness of app lies in the fact that they connect consumers with all local stores, selling grocery items. It is an on-demand store that delivers veggies, other grocery items, day to day products as required by the consumers.

        "Abstract": "In this project converter, it consists of image/video processing, Machine Learning and sound generation. For an image processing, it is a series of calculation techniques for analyzing, reconstructing, compressing, and enhancing images. When an object is given as an input, an image will captured through scanning or webcam; and it will be analyzed and manipulated, accomplished using various specialized software applications and output liker a monitor. Image processing and Machine Learning has several techniques, including template matching, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour), thresholding,CNN(deep learning) and etc. For the template matching, it is a technique for finding small parts of an image to match with the template image; it is also used to identify printed characters, numbers, and other small, simple objects. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) is an algorithm that can work very well in practice and easy to understand. It is also a lazy algorithm that does not use the training data points to do any generalization. Besides, thresholding technique is one of the most important approaches to image segmentation. It is a non-linear operation that can converts a gray-scale image into a binary image. The purpose of image processing and machine learning in this project is to analysis of a picture using techniques that can identify shades, colours and relationships that cannot be observed by the human eye. Besides that, an image processing is used to solve identification problems, i.e. in forensic medicine or in establishing weather maps from satellite photos. It assigns with images in bitmapped graphics form that have been scanned in or taken with digital cameras. For sound generation is to generate a sound through pytesseract library or play a wav file from computer or Google voice A",

The medical report of the patient can also be generated online with\nthe help of our project.\nOmnicare will also help in fixing an appointment with a doctor. When the\npatient tries to fix an appointment with the doctor, the patient’s data is stored in\nour software’s database. The timing and the schedule of the patient’s\nappointment is fixed by the doctor, according to the information available in the\ndatabase of our software.\n‘OMNICARE’ also provides improved access to patient data and it also\nimproves work efficiency. This means better and quicker clinical decisions. The\nfaster the clinician gets the diagnostic reports, the quicker he provides the\nmedicines. Thus, the faster is the patient’s recovery and the better it is on the\npatient care index. ‘OMNICARE’ will also provide data security of the patient\nand it is also cost effective since the money on visiting the doctor is saved due\nto online registration.",
